# Welcome to Dyscord.

Dyscord is an attempt to replace the discord.py library. There is no intention to provide 1:1 API compatibility, as there were several pain points from the original I intend to avoid.

If you are looking to get started, than take a peek at the [Examples](#examples) section.

## Support

Best place to get support is right on the [Dyscord discord](https://discord.gg/Q9NFzgZx). I can help out most times within a day. If that isn't working for you, try to [file an issue](https://github.com/isbe-house/dyscord/issues/new/choose) on Github.
