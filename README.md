# Current Status

Very much an active WIP. The API to this library is not at all locked down. Users can expect aggressive changes to the API until we hit v1.0.0

# Documentation

We are following [Google Style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) docstring patterns.
