# simple-discord

A simplistic implementation of the discord API.

[![Python Testing](https://github.com/jmurrayufo/simple-discord/actions/workflows/python-testing.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jmurrayufo/simple-discord/actions/workflows/python-testing.yml)

# Current Status

Very much an active WIP. The API to this library is not at all locked down. Users can expect aggressive changes to the API until we hit v1.0.0

# Documentation

We are following [Google Style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) docstring patterns.
