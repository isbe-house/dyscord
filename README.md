A simplistic implementation of the discord API.

Main: [![Python Testing](https://github.com/isbe.house/dyscord/actions/workflows/python-testing.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/isbe.house/dyscord/actions/workflows/python-testing.yml)

Dev: [![Python Testing](https://github.com/isbe.house/dyscord/actions/workflows/python-testing.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/isbe.house/dyscord/actions/workflows/python-testing.yml)

# Current Status

Very much an active WIP. The API to this library is not at all locked down. Users can expect aggressive changes to the API until we hit v1.0.0

# Documentation

We are following [Google Style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) docstring patterns.

Actual published documentation is still very much a WIP.
